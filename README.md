# Windows Optimization Guide  
A comprehensive guide to optimizing your Windows OS for significantly higher FPS and better performance.  

## Why Optimize Windows?  
Microsoft includes unnecessary features, ads, and bloatware that slow down your system. These background processes consume valuable resources, reducing FPS and overall performance.  

Take a look at how much unnecessary software is impacting your FPS!

## Is It Worth It?  
**Absolutely!** The best results I achieved were on my friend's computer, where FPS in Minecraft jumped **from 200-500 to an incredible 1800-2000!**

# Tutorial  

### 1. Install [AtlasOS](https://atlasos.net/) (Get started now > I'm following the guide, show me the downloads)
AtlasOS is the best Windows modification that removes **all** unnecessary bloatware, significantly improving performance and making Windows 10 much more enjoyable to use. <br>

### 2. Use [AdamX Optimization Pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQSkPmZRCjc)  
This optimization pack adjusts Windows settings that are, by default, configured for power saving instead of maximum performance.  

### 3. Configure [ParkControl](https://bitsum.com/parkcontrol/)  
- Set the **Power Profile** to **Bitsum Highest Performance**  
- This prevents Windows from disabling CPU cores to save power, ensuring maximum performance.
